A curated collection of engineering blogs on the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs) in production**.

If you've been searching for information on LLMs online, you've probably come across numerous articles explaining what LLMs are, how they work, steps for integrating them into your applications, and their potential applications in various industries. Two of the best ones I've read are from Chip Huyen ([Building LLM applications for production](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html#part_3_promising_use_cases)) and Eugene Yan ([Patterns for Building LLM-based Systems & Products](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/)).

> It's easy to make something cool with LLMs, but very hard to make something production-ready with them.

I wholeheartedly agree with Chip's statement in the linked blog post. On top of top that, I'd add that making something production-ready with LLMs that actually benefits a business (improves a business metric in a cost-efficient way) is damn hard! I have found it pretty hard to find blogs describing the use of LLMs in real products to tackle actual business issues.

I'll list the engineering blogs from different companies that I've explored and read here. These blogs detail real-world applications of LLMs in solving specific business problems. I hope they will provide valuable insights and ideas on how you might employ LLMs to address challenges in your business problems.

I'll keep the list updated as and when I find new blogs. If you find a blog that fits here, send a PR or share it with me!
